      "Okay, so I need to list all the stats of Virat Kohli. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with cricket statistics, but I know he's a big name in the sport. Let me try to figure out where to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that in cricket, there are different formats like Tests, ODIs, and T20Is. I think each has its own set of stats. So, I should probably break it down by these formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each format, I should include things like matches played, runs scored, highest score, centuries, half-centuries, average, strike rate, and maybe some other key stats. I've heard terms like \"centuries\" and \"half-centuries,\" which I think refer to scoring 100 runs and 50 runs in an innings, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember that Kohli has been the captain of the Indian team, so maybe I should include some captaincy stats too, like matches led, wins, losses, etc. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and there are awards and accolades. I think he's won the ICC Cricketer of the Year or something like that. Maybe multiple times. Also, he's been the top-ranked batsman in the world at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also consider his overall impact, like fastest to certain runs milestones. I think he's one of the fastest to reach 10,000 ODI runs or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not entirely sure about all the stats, so maybe I can recall some specific numbers. For example, in Tests, I think he has around 30 centuries. In ODIs, maybe over 40 centuries. T20Is, maybe around 30 half-centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention his average in each format. I believe he averages over 50 in Tests and ODIs, which is really good. In T20Is, the average might be a bit lower, but still solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike rate is another factor. In ODIs, he probably has a strike rate around 90, and in T20Is, maybe around 130. These are just guesses, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awards-wise, I think he's won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, which is the ICC Cricketer of the Year, a couple of times. Also, he's been the ICC ODI Player of the Year multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and he's the all-time leading run-scorer for India in ODIs, right? Or at least he was until someone else took over. Wait, I think he still holds that record.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure about the exact number of Man of the Match or Man of the Series awards he's won, but it must be a significant number given his performance over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captaincy stats: I think he led India in Tests and ODIs, maybe T20Is as well. His win-loss record as captain would be important. I believe he's one of the more successful Test captains for India, with a high number of wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also include some of his records, like the fastest to reach certain run milestones. For example, fastest to 10,000 ODI runs, or most consecutive ODI centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and in the IPL, he plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore and has been their captain. I think he's the leading run-scorer in the IPL, or at least among the top. So maybe include his IPL stats too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user mentioned \"all stats,\" so maybe include both international and domestic. But I'm not sure if they want that level of detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might be missing some stats, like catches, stumpings, or other fielding metrics, but since he's a batsman, those might not be as prominent. Still, maybe include catches and stumpings as part of his fielding contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, maybe mention his debut dates for each format. I think he made his ODI debut around 2008, Test debut a bit later, maybe 2011, and T20I debut around the same time as ODIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not entirely confident about all these numbers, so I might mix up some stats. For example, confusing Test and ODI centuries. I should be careful to separate them correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing is his performance in different conditions. I know he's done well both in India and overseas, which is a testament to his skill. Maybe mention that as part of his impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, his role in the team, like being a chase master in ODIs and T20Is, known for successfully chasing down targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's also among the fittest cricketers, which contributes to his longevity and performance. Maybe not a stat, but it's an important aspect of his career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should focus on the numerical stats rather than qualitative aspects. So, stick to runs, averages, centuries, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might forget some specific awards or records, but I can list the major ones I remember, like the ICC awards and unique records like most consecutive ODI centuries in chases.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider his performance in major tournaments, like the World Cup. How many runs he's scored there, any centuries, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the IPL, besides being a top scorer, he's been consistent over the years, so maybe mention his IPL centuries and total runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm starting to realize that there's a lot to cover, so organizing it by format and including key stats for each makes sense. Maybe also a section for awards and records, and captaincy stats.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might not have all the exact numbers right, but I can provide a comprehensive overview with the details I remember. If I'm unsure about a specific stat, I can note that it's approximate or subject to change as he's still active.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering he's still playing, some stats might have changed since my last knowledge update. So, it's important to mention that the stats are accurate as of a certain date.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I'll structure the response by listing each format with relevant stats, then move on to awards, records, captaincy, and maybe IPL stats. I'll try to be as accurate as possible with the numbers I remember, acknowledging any uncertainties.\n",

These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n",

On Thursday, Microsoft announced that it’s rolling OpenAI's reasoning model o1 out to its Copilot users, and now OpenAI is releasing a new reasoning model, o3-mini, to people who use the free version of ChatGPT. OpenAI’s o1-mini is 20 times more expensive to run than its equivalent non-reasoning model, GPT-4o mini.
